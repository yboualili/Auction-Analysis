# Introduction

This repository contains the solution to the Data Science Laboratory Course task. The task involved analyzing a simulated simultaneous multi-round auction with four bidders and six products. The goal was to investigate whether certain auction outcomes, such as a bidder winning a specific product at a given price, are possible based on the provided data.

In this task, i used the given training and test data to build a predictive model that could determine the likelihood of auction outcomes based on product prices, bidder capacities, and other relevant factors. The task required exploring the data, training baseline and predictive models, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We also needed to make predictions on test data and generate a prediction file for submission.

The steps involved in the analysis include:

    Exploring the dataset with descriptive statistics and visualizations.
    Training at least one baseline model and one appropriate prediction model.
    Evaluating model performance using the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).
    Generating predictions on test data and creating a CSV file with the results.

The final submission includes:

    A Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis and code.
    An HTML export of the notebook.
    A prediction file in CSV format containing the predictions for the test data.

The goal of this task was to demonstrate the ability to apply data science techniques to a real-world scenario and make accurate predictions based on the provided dataset, while also adhering to methodological and reproducibility standards.
